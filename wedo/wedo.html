          <h2 class="mt-0">YSP PEACE PERSPECTIVE</h2>
          <h5>What is peace?</h5>
          <p>
            Peace is typically understood as an absence of conflict or war. However, being in a static state of no conflict does not create true peace. Peace requires a dynamic relationship of harmony where two entities are working together in a mutually beneficial way. The driving force for harmony is the intention of living for the sake of others, or in short, love. Without love, there is no harmony, and there is no peace.
          </p>
          <p>
            In YSP we have 3 main areas of peace that we focus on. The first is peace within ourselves, which is having harmony between our conscience and our actions. The second is peace with others, which involves building healthy relations with our family, our peers and our community. And the third is peace with our physical environment, which includes taking care of our home, our neighborhood, and the natural world. 
          </p>
          <p>
            YSP shares and applies this perspective of peace with young people through our character education programs and peace designer seminars. President Theodore Roosevelt once said, “To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society”. Through the character education we equip youth to practice good morals in all aspects of their lives, and through the Peace Projects we have them practice peace proactively in their communities through service. A culture of service and living for others is the key for sustainable peace. The more we can reach the youth with this message and training, the more we can secure a peaceful future.
