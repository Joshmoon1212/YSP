            <li>
                Submit a 3-4 minute version of a video recording of your presentation slides with your voice speaking as the slides move. (This can be done with a zoom account or PowerPoint program)
            </li>
            <li>
                Include an attachment of your presentation script and slide presentation.

                If you are submitting a presentation as a group, please choose one representative to speak and record the presentation whom you would want to present for the live competition. Having multiple team members speak in the presentation is accepted, but must still stay within the time limit for the submission and live presentation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The submissions will be reviewed by a committee and the top submissions then move on to be presented live on stage or live online for the S!NERGY event. These live presentations need to be 7-10 minutes long and be on the topic of the theme decided for the specific S!NERGY event. There are Local, National, Regional and International level S!NERGY events that can be participated in.</p>

          <h1>RULES FOR ENTERING TO MULTIPLE S!NERGY COMPETITIONS</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 p-4 ps-md-0">
          <p>Participants may submit multiple presentations to the same competition, but only one submitted from the same person can be chosen.</p>
          <ul class="lst">
            <li>
                The same presentation can be submitted to different S!NERGY Competitions as long as they are not of the same level (i.e. Local, State, National). Local level S!NERGYs are usually hosted by a local YSP chapter in partnership with a city, school or organization. A State level S!NERGY would be open to multiple cities/counties within a state. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Note: all these rules apply only if you placed and won a grant from the S!NERGY event, not if you just submitted a recording.
            </li>
            <li>
                All National S!NERGY competitions are shown on this website. Participants cannot enter the same presentation to multiple National S!NERGY competitions listed above (excluding S!NERGY x USA that leads to the International Competition), but the same presenter is allowed to enter a different presentation to all National level competitions.
            </li>
            <li>
                S!NERGY x USA is an annual competition where the winner will go on to compete on the Regional and International level competitions. The presentation rule to enter this specific National competition is if you did not win 1st place in the previous year’s S!NERGY x USA competition. You are allowed to enter this competition even if you entered one of the other National Level S!NERGYs and won a grant.
